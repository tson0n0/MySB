\"\$get_base_path\"		--> Initial download tree
\"\$get_custom1\"		--> New download tree
\"\$get_name\"			--> Download name
\"\$get_loaded_file\"	--> Torrent file tree

To send mail from your script, you can use the following command:
	subject=\"MySB - NAS transfer finished !\"
	curl --data \"username=$UserName&get_custom1=$get_custom1&get_name=$get_name&subject=$subject\" http://localhost:$gsPort_System_HTTP/rTorrent

Your scripts must have the extension '.sh'. They will be executed at the end of a download in alphabetical order.
The script 'synchro.sh' should be enough if you plan to synchronize with RSYNC (via SSH) or FTPs.
The connection information is to inquire via the portal (MySB Portal > User > Synchronization).

Set a list of categories (MySB Portal > User > Synchronization), then choose the appropriate synchronize mode.
For example:
	Linux		-->	Synchronization starts immediately after its download via rTorrent.
	Travail		--> The synchronization will be performed at the time you programmed.
	Autres		-->	No synchronization, the files remain on your server.

NOTES:
	1/	Consider adding your planning (MySB Portal> User > Synchronization), otherwise the relevant categories will never be synchronized...
	2/	Categories (subfolders) you add will also respected on the destination of the synchronization.
		This means that if you synchronize 'Linux\ubuntu.iso', it will be copied into 'Linux\ubuntu.iso'.")
